## Exploring and visualizing Ajio product sales data using Python.

# Ajio Sales Data Cleaning Workshop Project

This project was completed as part of a **Python workshop conducted by WSCubeTech**.  
The main objective of the workshop was to explore **data cleaning and preprocessing techniques using Python**, applying them to a real-world Ajio sales dataset.  
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in handling missing values, standardizing product categories, formatting sales data, and preparing the dataset for further analysis or visualization.
It was a great opportunity to strengthen practical skills in **data cleaning, manipulation, and Python programming** in a business context.
